This application requires libircclient 0.5.0, which was released in November
2010. It also works with libircclient trunk past 0.5.0, but does not check
whether the trunk version is correct, so make sure you have an up-to-date
version.

To compile DaVinci, run qmake and make in the main directory:
  qmake
  make

This creates a 'davinci' binary in the 'data' directory that you can run. If
you intend to run DaZeus 2.0 elsewhere, manually copy the 'data' directory
there.

For the Perl plugin (which is always enabled[0]) you need some Perl modules
to be installed: Data::Dumper, Storable and MIME::Base64. They are likely
already installed and otherwise it's probably easiest to install them
via your package manager. Otherwise, consult `man cpan`.

[0] It can be disabled, but there is no supported option to do so. If you
would like to disable it, let me know, I'll try to help you.
