This application requires libircclient 0.5.0. At this moment, 0.5.0 is only
in the Hg repository, but it will be released soon.

To compile DaVinci, first compile the Perl modules from plugins/perl:
  cd plugins/perl
  make
Then, run qmake and make in the main directory:
  cd ../..
  qmake
  make

This creates a 'davinci' binary that you can run or manually copy to whatever
bin directory you want.
